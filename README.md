# JNP1-Projects
Projects created as part of the "Languages and tools for programming I" course held in the academic year 2022/2023 at MIM UW.

On this subject, we explored the secrets of the C++ language. The classes consisted of writing projects in groups of two or three (except for the last task).

## top7
The task was to implement a program that supports the hit list. Tracks are 
numbered with integers from 1 to 99999999.

_Topics_: STL, regex.

## hash

The task was to write a "hash" module in C++ that provides hash tables of 
uint64_t type sequences in C.

_Topics_: More STL, merging C++ code with C code, initializing global objects.

## moneybag

The task was to implement the class Moneybag representing purses in the country 
of francs.

_Topics_: Object-oriented programming in C++, classes, constructors, operators 
overloading, exceptions, initialization lists, keywords: const, constexpr, etc.

## organism

The goal of the task was to write code to simulate the interaction of organisms 
in the natural environment.

_Topics_: Templates, classes, constexpr functions, templates with variable 
number of arguments, fold expressions.
