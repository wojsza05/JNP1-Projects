# JNP1-Projects
Projects created as part of the "Languages and tools for programming I" course held in the academic year 2022/2023 at MIM UW.

On this subject, we explored the secrets of the C++ language. The classes consisted of writing projects in groups of two or three (except for the last task).

## top7
The task was to implement a program that supports the hit list. Tracks are 
numbered with integers from 1 to 99999999.

_Topics_: STL, regex.

## hash

The task was to write a "hash" module in C++ that provides hash tables of 
uint64_t type sequences in C.

_Topics_: More STL, merging C++ code with C code, initializing global objects.

## moneybag

The task was to implement the class Moneybag representing purses in the country 
of francs.

_Topics_: Object-oriented programming in C++, classes, constructors, operators 
overloading, exceptions, initialization lists, keywords: const, constexpr, etc.

## organism

The goal of the task was to write code to simulate the interaction of organisms 
in the natural environment.

_Topics_: Templates, classes, constexpr functions, templates with variable 
number of arguments, fold expressions.

## kvfifo

The goal of this task was to implement a container pattern that behaves like a 
fifo queue, where each element has a key assigned to it. This container should 
provide strong exception-resistance guarantees and implement copy-on-write 
semantics.

_Topics_: Copy-on-write, move semantics, smart pointers, exceptions, STL, 
templates.

## worldcup

The task was to create a program simulating a board game about the football 
world cup. The `worldcup.h` file was provided by the authors of the task.

_Topics_: Object-oriented programming in C++, many classes, inheritance, 
exceptions.

## images

The task was to write a module useful in creating functional images. The files 
`bmp.*`, `color.*`, `coordinate.*` and `example.cc` were provided by the authors 
of the task.

_Topics_: Functional programming in C++, lambda expressions, templates, fold 
expressions.
